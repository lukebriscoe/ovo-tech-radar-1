<h3>What is the OVO Tech Radar?</h3>

<p>
The OVO Tech Radar is a living document that exists to make visible the risks
and rewards involved with the existent and nascent technologies we are using
across the OVO Group.  It is a list of technologies assigned in to four rings,
with the following semantics:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>ADOPT</b> &mdash; Technologies we have high confidence in to serve our purpose, also in large
        scale.  Technologies with a usage culture in our OVO production environment, low
        risk and recommended to be widely used..</li>
    
    <li><b>TRIAL</b> &mdash; Technologies that we have seen work with success in project work to solve a real
        problem; first serious usage experience that confirm benefits and can uncover
        limitations.  These technologies are slightly more risky; some engineers in our
        organisation have used them before and will share knowledge and experiences.</li>
    
    <li><b>ASSESS</b> &mdash; Technologies that are promising and have clear potential value-add for us;
        technologies worth investing research and proof of concenpt efforts in to see if
        they may add value.  These technologies have higher risks; they are often brand
        new and highly unproven in our organisation.  You will find some engineers that
        have knowledge in the technology and promote it, you may even find teams that
        have started a proof of concept effort.</li>
    
    <li><b>HOLD</b> &mdash; Technologies not recommended to be used for new projects.  Technologies that we
        think are not (yet) worth to (further) invest in.  They technologies should not
        be used for new projects, but usually can be continued for existing projects.</li>
</ul>
